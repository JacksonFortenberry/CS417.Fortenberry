# CS417 – Assignment 1: CAD Shapes

This repository contains my submission for **Assignment 1** of CS417.

## Description
This project is a simple computer-aided design (CAD) program that lets the user create four types of shapes:
- Triangle
- Circle
- Square
- Rectangle

The program asks the user to select a shape, enter its dimensions and position `(x, y)`, and then outputs the perimeter and area of the shape.

## File Structure
- `apps/Assignment1.cpp` – main program with all shape classes.
