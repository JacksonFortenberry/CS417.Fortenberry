Got it 👍 Here’s a **student-style README.md** you can drop into your GitHub repo. It explains your project, structure, and how to run it, in the way an instructor would expect.

# 📘 Tree ADT with Index Card Application

## Overview

This project implements a **binary search tree (BST)** in C++ as a template class `Tree<T>` and demonstrates its use with a custom `IndexCard` class.
The program simulates organizing index cards by keyword and ID, similar to how students used to prepare research notes before computers.

---

## Features

* **Tree\<T>**

  * Generic binary search tree using smart pointers.
  * Supports insertion, searching, and tree traversals (`inorder`, `preorder`, `postorder`).
* **IndexCard**

  * Stores `id`, `keyword`, and `note`.
  * Comparison operators allow cards to be sorted in the tree by ID.
* **Application**

  * Inserts a sample deck of index cards.
  * Prints tree contents in sorted order.
  * Allows the user to search for a card by ID.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd project-root
   ```
2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ apps/main.cpp -Iinclude -o indexcards
   ```
3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./indexcards
   ```

## Example Output

### Inorder Traversal

```
Inorder Traversal (by ID):
[1] AI: Artificial Intelligence basics
[2] ML: Machine Learning applications
[3] DS: Data Structures notes
```

### Successful Search

```
Enter ID to search: 2
Found: [2] ML: Machine Learning applications
```

### Unsuccessful Search

```
Enter ID to search: 5
Key not found
```
